<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I began as a freelance designer and worked my way up to leading creative direction 
  and marketing at Core Catering Supplies. Along the way, I honed my skills in design, 
  storytelling, and strategy, but I’ve always been hungry to grow.</p>

<p>Right now, I’m diving into web development and software engineering, blending 
  creativity with code to craft digital experiences that stand out. </p>

<p>My love for anime, cyberpunk aesthetics, and narrative-driven projects fuels my 
  imagination. At heart, I’m playful, disciplined, and driven to turn ideas into visible 
  achievements.</p>
